*  `weight`: Sets the order in the left navigation with 1 at the top and 10000 at the bottom.
*  `title`: the text that shows in the left navigation for the title
*  `bookToc`: Hides the page-specific table of content (on the right-hand side of the page)
*  `bookFlatSection`: If set to true, promotes the pages at this level to the same tier as the _index page.
